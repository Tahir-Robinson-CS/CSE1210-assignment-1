## Setting up a GitHub hosted web page
Follow these instructions to set up a GitHub hosted web page of your assignment.

1. Go to the Setting tab.
2. Scroll down to the __GitHub Pages__ heading (about half way down the page).
3. In the __Source__ pull down menu select __master branch__.
4. Click the __Launch automatic page generator__ button. 
5. On the next page (called New project site), scroll to the bottom and click on the green button __Continue to layouts__. Do not change any settings or text on this page.
6. On the next page, select a page template (any page template will do) and click on the green __Publish page__ button...
7. ... this will take you back to your repository landing page. Notice the link to your published web page on top of the page (in a light blue box). The URL for your web page will have the following format https://qehscs.github.io/CSE1210-assignment-1-Tony-Stark-CS/ where Tony-Stark-CS will be replaced with your GitHub user name.
8. Copy the web page URL 
9. Open up this README.md file for editing and paste in the URL on top of the page after the "My URL: " line. Commit the README.md file.

## Customizing the Webpage
Open up two tabs in your browser, navigate to your webpage in one of the tabs and to your assignment repository in the other tab. Open up the ```index.html``` file for editing (make sure you use __soft wrap__ in the GitHub code editor to have linebreaks) in your browser and customize your web page in the following ways:

1. Change the line __This project is maintained by QEHSCS__ by replacing QEHSCS with your name.

Before continuing find and look closely at the HTML markup in the ```index.html``` file where the text of web page is included.. In particular notice the opening and closing  tags that are used to format the text, in particular the ```<h3>``` and ```</h3>```, ```<p>``` and ```</p>``` and ```<a href="...">``` and ```</a>``` tags.

You will now replace the default web page text with your own information.

2. Select a country of your choice 
3. Replace the title of the web page with the name of the country. Note that the title of the web page appears both in the tab and on top of the page.
4. Set up the following headings: Capital, Official Languages, Population Size, Land Area in Square Kilometers, Currency. Follwing each heading include the necessary text providing the indicated information. For example, under the heading Capital provide the name of the capital city of the country.
5. At the bottom of the web page include the following text __See Wikipedia for more information__ with the text linking to the corresponding Wikipedia page for the country.
6. Bonus Challenge: Add a picture of the country's flag to your web page.  

Before turning in your assignment make sure that the web page is formatted properly and nicely. Spelling mistakes, typos and ugly formatting will all result in deductions.

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
